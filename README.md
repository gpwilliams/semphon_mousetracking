# semphon_mousetracking

This task presents participants with four written words in a quadrant. Participants are tasked with listening to audio and clicking on one of the four words presented in the quadrant on mention. The four words presented can consist of:

1. Semantic and Phonological Condition: A target (e.g. mail), phonologically-related competitor (e.g. male), semantically-related competitor (e.g. letter), and unrelated distractor (e.g. earring).
2. Phonological Condition: The same as in 1, but with the semantically-related competitor replaced by another distractor.
3. Semantic Condition: The same as in 1, but with the phonologically-related competitor replaced by another distractor.
4. Control Condition: A target (e.g. mail), and three unrelated distractors.

Crucially, the sentences in which the target item is mentioned is provided in a semantically-biasing context (e.g. "The postmaster thinks about the..."). 

Throughout, mouse (or trackpad) coordinates and the timing and accuracy in which a selection is made is gathered. Trials indicate when a selection has been made (after which another selection cannot be made), and inter-stimulus intervals in the form of a central fixation dot change colour to indicate whether the response to the trial was correct, incorrect, or not made. Trials only progress when participants click the central fixation dot prior to the trial to ensure mouse coordinates start in the centre of the screen (i.e. away from any areas of interest/words) at the beginning of the trial.
